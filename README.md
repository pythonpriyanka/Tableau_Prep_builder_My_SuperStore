Here's the story...
You work at the headquarters for a large retail chain. Your boss wants to analyze product sales and profits over the last four years for the company. You suggest that he use Tableau Desktop to do that. Your boss thinks that's a great idea and wants you to get right on that.

As you start gathering all the data you'll need, you notice that the data has been collected and tracked differently for each region. You also notice a lot of creative data entry in the different files, and that one region even has a separate file for each year!

Before you can start analyzing the data in Tableau, you'll have to do some serious data cleaning first, and it's going to be a long night.

As you rummage for restaurant menus to order some dinner, you remember that Tableau has a product called Tableau Prep that might help you with your Herculean data cleaning tasks
